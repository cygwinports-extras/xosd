sdesc: "X11 on-screen display (utility)"
ldesc: "XOSD displays text on your screen, sounds simple right? The 
difference is it is unmanaged and shaped, so it appears transparent. 
This gives the effect of an On Screen Display, like your TV/VCR etc.. 
The package also includes xmms and bmp plugins."
